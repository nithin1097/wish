We have waited so long to have you among us. At last, the time has come. 

We are most delightfully welcoming you to join us today!

You are a wonderful person with a wonderful view of life.
 
Your companionship is always an opportunity to learn. 

A warm welcome to you to join us!

Life seldom gives a chance to know someone who can influence us so deeply. 

I’m lucky to have the opportunity to meet you! Welcome into my life!

I’m so glad to welcome you to my [new] house. 

Your presence in our [new] home is nothing less than a blessing to us!
